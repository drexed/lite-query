Lite::Query is a library for using the query pattern to separate complex query
logic from classes such as controllers and models.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lite-query'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lite-query

## Setup

### Generators

Use `rails g query NAME` will generate the following files:

```erb
app/queries/[name]_query.rb
```

If a `ApplicationQuery` file in the `app/queries` directory is available, the
generator will create file that inherit from `ApplicationQuery` if not it will
fallback to `Lite::Query::Base`.

### Query

You will need to fill this class with the required `execute` method as shown below:

```ruby
class AgeQuery < ApplicationQuery

  # NOTE: This instance method is required
  def execute
    return relation unless args[:age]

    relation.where('age > ?', args[:age])
  end

  private

  def default_relation
    User.all
  end

end
```

## Usage

There are multiple ways to access the query call:

```ruby
relation = User.limit(1)

query = AgeQuery.new(relation)
query.call

# - or -

query = AgeQuery.new(age: 10)
query.exectue

# - or -

AgeQuery.call(relation, age: 20)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
